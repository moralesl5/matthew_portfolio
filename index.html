				<div class="typeFour">I am a meditator, reader, writer and lover of life.</div>
				<div class="typeFive">I founded three companies, the first when I was 22, creating a marketplace that provides convenient and affordable access to fitness clubs and healthy living. I am currently CEO of <a target="_blank_" href="http://www.goalspriing.com">Goalspriing</a> which is reinventing coaching for the modern workforce. I've coached more than 100 executives at private, venture-backed companies since our inception.</div>
				<div class="typeSix">This quote speaks to who I am.</div>
				<div class="typeSeven">"The master in the art of living makes little distinction between his work and his play, his labor and his leisure, his mind and his body, his education and his recreation, his love and his religion. He hardly knows which is which. He simply pursues his vision of excellence at whatever he does, leaving others to decide whether he is working or playing. To him he is always doing both." â€” L.P.
